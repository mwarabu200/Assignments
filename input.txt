File Handling in Python is the ability to perform various operations on files, like reading from and writing to them.
 Files are used to store data permanently (like text documents, images, or spreadsheets). 
Unlike variables, which lose their values when a program ends, files provide persistent storage.
Use with for file handling: Auto-close files, preventing potential leaks.
Check file existence before reading/writing, to avoid crashes.
Handle specific exceptions over general ones (e.g., FileNotFoundError instead of Exception).
Document error messages clearly for easier debugging and user support.this is a modified version of input.txt this is a modified version of input.txt this is a modified version of input.txt
